## 📦 **Option 1: Python Package (Easiest - 5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Test Local Installation**
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Test the commands
youtube-dl-gui    # Should open GUI
youtube-dl-cli --help  # Should show CLI help
```

### **Step 2: Build Package**
```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build the package
python -m build

# This creates:
# dist/youtube-downloader-secure-2.0.0.tar.gz
# dist/youtube_downloader_secure-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### **Step 3: Upload to PyPI**
```bash
# Create PyPI account at https://pypi.org/account/register/

# Upload to Test PyPI first (recommended)
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from Test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ youtube-downloader-secure

# If everything works, upload to real PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

**Result**: Users can install with `pip install youtube-downloader-secure` 🎉

## 💻 **Option 2: Standalone Executables (10 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Build Executables**

# Test the built executables
cd dist
./YouTube-Downloader-GUI    # GUI version
./YouTube-Downloader-CLI --help  # CLI version
```

### **Step 3: Create Release Package**
```bash
# Create a release folder
mkdir YouTube-Downloader-v2.0.0
cp dist/YouTube-Downloader-* YouTube-Downloader-v2.0.0/

# Create ZIP for distribution
