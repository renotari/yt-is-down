**Project**: YouTube Downloader (Python)  
**Size**: ~2,400 lines of code  
**Purpose**: Desktop application for downloading YouTube videos/playlists with GUI and CLI interfaces

## 📋 Review Request

Please analyze this Python codebase and provide feedback on:
1. **Code Quality**: Structure, readability, maintainability
2. **Potential Issues**: Bugs, security concerns, performance problems
3. **Best Practices**: Python conventions, error handling, architecture
4. **Suggestions**: Improvements without overengineering

## 📁 COMPLETE SOURCE CODE

### **1. Core Download Logic** (`downloader.py`)
```python

## 🎯 Specific Questions

1. **Architecture**: Is the current structure appropriate for a 2,400-line desktop app?
2. **Error Handling**: Are we handling YouTube API restrictions appropriately?
3. **Rate Limiting**: Are our 15-25 second delays between downloads reasonable?
4. **Code Organization**: Any obvious improvements without overengineering?
5. **Security**: Any security concerns with downloading from YouTube?
6. **Performance**: Any obvious performance bottlenecks?
7. **Python Best Practices**: Are we following Python conventions well?

## 🚫 What We DON'T Want

Please avoid suggesting:
- Enterprise patterns (service layers, dependency injection)
- Complex architectures (MVC, microservices)
- Over-abstraction for a simple desktop app
- Patterns more suited to large team development

## ✅ What We DO Want

- Practical improvements for maintainability
- Bug fixes or security improvements
- Better Python idioms
- Performance optimizations
- User experience improvements

## 📊 Recent Improvements Made

We recently refactored to address:
- ✅ Eliminated all magic numbers (centralized to config)
- ✅ Standardized error messages for better UX
- ✅ Split overly long methods (200+ lines → ~100 lines)
- ✅ Improved code organization without overengineering

## 🔍 Focus Areas

Please pay special attention to:
1. **YouTube API Interaction**: Are we being respectful to YouTube's servers?
2. **Error Recovery**: How well do we handle network issues and API changes?
3. **User Experience**: Are error messages helpful and progress tracking clear?
4. **Code Maintainability**: Can a new developer easily understand and modify this?
5. **Edge Cases**: Any scenarios we might not be handling well?
